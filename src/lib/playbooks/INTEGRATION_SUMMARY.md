### Automated Testing

**Unit Tests Needed:**

- `usePlaybookOnboarding` hook
- Onboarding component rendering
- Navigation flow logic
- Error handling scenarios

**Integration Tests Needed:**

- Complete apply playbook flow
- Onboarding completion flow
- Error recovery flows

**E2E Tests Needed:**

- First-time user journey
- Apply playbook to plant
- Community template adoption

## Known Limitations

1. **Mock Data**: Currently using mock data for:
   - Available playbooks list
   - Plant selection
   - Community templates
   - These need to be connected to real data sources

2. **Plant Creation**: The guided plant creation flow needs to be implemented in the plants module

3. **Deep Linking**: Deep links from strain details to playbooks need to be wired up

4. **Performance**: FlashList performance with 1k+ items needs profiling

## Next Steps

1. **Connect Real Data**
   - Wire up playbook service to load actual playbooks
   - Connect to plants database
   - Integrate community templates API

2. **Complete Plant Integration**
   - Implement guided plant creation
   - Add return-to-playbook flow
   - Handle plant selection edge cases

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile FlashList with large datasets
   - Optimize re-renders
   - Add memoization where needed

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for new components
   - Add integration tests for flows
   - Create E2E test scenarios

5. **Polish**
   - Fine-tune animations
   - Improve error messages
   - Add more helpful hints
   - Enhance empty states
