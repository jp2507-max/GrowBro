- Monitoring and health check intervals

#### Configuration Schema:

```typescript
interface ModerationConfig {
  environment: 'development' | 'staging' | 'production';
  features: FeatureFlags;
  sla: SLAConfig;
  dsa: DSAConfig;
  pii: PIIConfig;
  ageVerification: AgeVerificationConfig;
  geoLocation: GeoLocationConfig;
  audit: AuditConfig;

  rateLimiting: RateLimitingConfig;
  monitoring: MonitoringConfig;
}
```

### 2. Health Check System

- Overall system health aggregation
- Response time tracking
- Timeout handling
- Default health checks for:
  - Database connectivity
  - DSA Transparency DB
  - Audit service
  - Age verification service
  - Geo-location service

#### Health Check Response Format:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T10:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "uptime": 3600000,
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "database",
      "status": "healthy",
      "message": "Database connection is healthy",
      "lastCheck": "2025-10-23T10:00:00Z",
      "responseTime": 45
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Migration Workflow:

1. Register migration with up/down SQL
2. Calculate checksum for integrity
3. Apply migration with transaction safety
4. Track status and execution time
5. Support rollback to previous state

### 4. Credential Management

**Location**: `src/lib/moderation/config/credential-manager.ts`

#### Features:

- Secure credential storage

#### Credential Types:

```typescript
type CredentialType =
  | 'dsa_transparency_db'
  | 'age_verification_provider'
  | 'ods_provider'
  | 'geo_location_provider';
```

### 5. Deployment Automation

**Location**: `scripts/deploy-moderation.js`

#### Features:

- Automated deployment script for all environments
- Pre-deployment validation:
  - Environment file checks
  - Environment variable validation
  - Test execution
  - Type checking
  - Linting
- Build automation
- Database migration execution
- Health check verification
- Backup creation (production only)
- Rollback support

#### Usage:

```bash
# Deploy to development
node scripts/deploy-moderation.js development

# Deploy to staging with all checks
node scripts/deploy-moderation.js staging

# Deploy to production (with backup)
node scripts/deploy-moderation.js production

# Skip specific checks
node scripts/deploy-moderation.js staging --skip-tests --skip-lint
```

### 6. Documentation

**Location**: `docs/`

#### Files Created:

- `moderation-deployment-guide.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- `moderation-deployment-summary.md` - This summary document

#### Documentation Includes:

- Environment configuration examples
- Database migration procedures
- Health check setup
- Deployment steps for each environment
- Rollback procedures
- Credential management
- Monitoring and alerting

## Environment Configuration

### Development

- All features enabled for testing
- No external service integrations
- Extended health check intervals (60s)
- Sentry disabled

### Staging

- Gradual feature enablement
- Test credentials for external services
- Standard health check intervals (30s)
- Sentry enabled

### Production

   - Configure age verification provider
   - Set up ODS provider integration
   - Configure geo-location service

3. **Testing**:
   - Run full integration tests
   - Perform load testing
   - Validate health checks
   - Test rollback procedures

4. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Configure Sentry alerts
   - Set up health check monitoring
   - Configure SLA breach alerts
   - Set up compliance violation alerts

5. **Documentation Review**:
   - Legal review of compliance documentation
   - Security audit of credential management
   - Operational runbook validation
