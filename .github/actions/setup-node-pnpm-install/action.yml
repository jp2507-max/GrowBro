# Composite actions docs: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action

# ✍️ Description:
# This is a composite action, which means it can be used in other actions.
# It is used in almost all workflows to set up the environment and install dependencies.
# Updating  the package manager or Node version here will be reflected in all workflows.

# 👀 Example usage:
#       - name : 📦 Setup Node + PNPM + install deps
#         uses: ./.github/actions/setup-node-pnpm-install

name: 'Setup  Node + PNPM + Install Dependencies'

runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20
        cache: 'pnpm'
        cache-dependency-path: 'pnpm-lock.yaml'
    - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
      with:
        run_install: false
        # Use Node 20-compatible pnpm/action-setup v4 (tags auto-update minor/patch)
        # NOTE: Using a tag here is acceptable since upstream maintains v4 for Node20.
        # If you prefer pinning to a commit SHA, replace `v4` with the latest commit for v4.
        # See: https://github.com/pnpm/action-setup
        # Also align PNPM version with package.json `packageManager` field
