**LIA ID:** LIA-MOD-001
**Processing Operation:** Content Moderation and Reporting
**Date Created:** 2025-10-21
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** Approved
**Approved By:** [Data Protection Officer]
**Approval Date:** [Pending Final Review]

## Purpose and Legitimate Interest

### Purpose

Maintain a safe, trustworthy platform environment free from illegal and harmful content through systematic content moderation and user reporting mechanisms.

### Legitimate Interest

Platform safety and user protection require processing personal data to prevent harmful content distribution and ensure compliance with legal obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA).

## Necessity Test

### Question

Is content moderation necessary for platform safety?

### Answer

Yes. No viable alternative exists to systematic content moderation for identifying and removing harmful content. User reports are essential to detect policy violations that automated systems cannot reliably identify.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **No moderation** - Unacceptable, exposes users to harm and violates DSA requirements
2. **Fully automated moderation** - Insufficient, lacks contextual understanding and appeals processes
3. **Human-only moderation with automated priority scoring** - Selected approach, balances effectiveness with scalability

## Balancing Test

### Controller Interests

- Maintain safe platform environment for all users
- Comply with DSA Notice-and-Action requirements (Art. 16, 17)
- Protect users from harmful, illegal, or inappropriate content
- Preserve platform reputation and user trust

### Data Subject Interests and Rights

- Privacy protection through data minimization
- Fairness in moderation decisions
- Right to appeal moderation decisions
- Right to access personal data processed
- Right to erasure after retention period

### Safeguards Implemented

1. **Content snapshots stored as hashes** - Not full content duplication to minimize data exposure
2. **PII scrubbed from transparency reports** - Pseudonymized identifiers prevent re-identification
3. **Reporter contact collected only when DSA-required** - Exceptions are documented and justified
4. **12-month default retention** - Not indefinite storage; aligned with legal defense needs
5. **Appeals process with different reviewers** - Conflict-of-interest prevention and fairness assurance

### Conclusion

Platform safety interests outweigh the minimal data processing required. All safeguards are in place via data minimization, retention limits, and comprehensive appeals processes. The processing is proportionate and necessary for the platform's core safety mission.

## Data Processing Details

### Data Categories Processed

- User identifiers (reporter/moderator tracking)
- Content reports with mandatory DSA fields
- Moderation decisions and reasoning
- Audit trails for transparency

### Processing Principles

- **Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency** - Clear privacy notices and processing explanations
- **Purpose Limitation** - Processing limited to content moderation and DSA compliance
- **Data Minimization** - Only necessary data collected and retained
- **Accuracy** - Regular validation of moderation decisions
- **Storage Limitation** - 12-month retention with automated deletion
- **Integrity and Confidentiality** - Encrypted storage and access controls
- **Accountability** - Comprehensive audit trails and documentation

## Risk Assessment

### Privacy Risks

- **Re-identification risk** - Mitigated through pseudonymization and PII scrubbing
- **Excessive data collection** - Mitigated through strict field requirements
- **Long-term retention** - Mitigated through 12-month limit and automated deletion

### Mitigation Measures

- Deterministic PII scrubbing with environment-specific salts
- Regular privacy impact assessments
- Automated compliance monitoring
- User rights automation (access, rectification, erasure)

## Review and Monitoring

### Review Schedule

Annual review with immediate updates upon processing changes or legal requirements modifications.

### Monitoring

- Automated compliance checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular audit trail reviews
- User complaint monitoring
- Privacy impact assessment updates
