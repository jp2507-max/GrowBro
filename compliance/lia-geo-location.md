# Legitimate Interests Assessment: Geo-Location and Regional Content Restrictions

**LIA ID:** LIA-GEO-001
**Processing Operation:** Geo-Location and Regional Content Restrictions
**Date Created:** 2025-10-21
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** Approved
**Approved By:** [Data Protection Officer]
**Approval Date:** [Pending Final Review]

## Purpose and Legitimate Interest

### Purpose

Comply with regional laws and prevent distribution of illegal content in restricted jurisdictions through location-based content restrictions.

### Legitimate Interest

Legal compliance and regional content restrictions require location detection to enforce geo-blocking and prevent illegal content distribution in restricted jurisdictions.

## Necessity Test

### Question

Is IP geolocation necessary for geo-blocking enforcement?

### Answer

Yes. IP geolocation is necessary to enforce geo-blocking per regional laws and moderation decisions. GPS location is optional and requires explicit consent for enhanced accuracy.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **No geo-blocking** - Unacceptable, violates regional laws and content restrictions
2. **User-declared location** - Unreliable and easily circumvented by users
3. **IP geolocation with GPS consent option** - Selected, EDPB-compliant approach

## Balancing Test

### Controller Interests

- Legal compliance with regional content laws
- Regional content restrictions enforcement
- Prevention of illegal content distribution
- Platform safety and legal risk mitigation

### Data Subject Interests and Rights

- Privacy protection through minimal data processing
- No persistent location tracking or storage
- Right to appeal geo-blocking decisions
- Right to dispute location detection
- Right to access current detected location

### Safeguards Implemented

1. **Default to server-side IP geolocation** - No consent required per ePrivacy guidelines
2. **GPS only with explicit consent** - Clear user benefit and control
3. **No device fingerprinting without consent** - ePrivacy Directive compliance
4. **Cached decisions with 1-hour TTL** - No long-term location storage
5. **Appeal process for false positives** - Manual review and correction mechanisms

### Conclusion

Legal compliance interests justify minimal IP processing for geo-blocking enforcement. GPS location requires explicit consent per ePrivacy requirements. Appeal processes mitigate false positive risks.

## Data Processing Details

### Data Categories Processed

- IP address (session-based geolocation)
- GPS coordinates (optional, with consent)
- Derived country/region (cached, 1-hour TTL)

### Processing Principles

- **Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency** - Clear geo-blocking policies and consent mechanisms
- **Purpose Limitation** - Processing limited to geo-blocking and legal compliance
- **Data Minimization** - Session-based processing, no persistent storage
- **Accuracy** - Regular validation of geolocation accuracy
- **Storage Limitation** - 1-hour cache TTL, no long-term retention
- **Integrity and Confidentiality** - Secure processing and transmission
- **Accountability** - Audit trails for geo-blocking decisions

## Risk Assessment

### Privacy Risks

- **Location tracking** - Mitigated through session-based processing and short cache TTL
- **Device fingerprinting** - Mitigated through consent requirements for GPS
- **False positives in geo-blocking** - Mitigated through appeal processes

### Mitigation Measures

- Server-side IP geolocation (no terminal equipment access without consent)
- Short cache durations for location data
- Clear consent mechanisms for GPS usage
- Appeal processes for incorrect geo-blocking
- Regular accuracy testing and monitoring

## Geo-Blocking Implementation

### Detection Methods

- **IP Geolocation** - Server-side, no consent required (EDPB guidance)
- **GPS Location** - Client-side, explicit consent required
- **User Override** - Manual location correction with verification

### Legal Compliance

- German NetzDG requirements
- French hate speech laws
- Other regional content restriction laws
- DSA territorial scope requirements

## Consent Mechanisms

### GPS Location Consent

- **Freely Given** - Users can use platform with IP geolocation only
- **Specific** - GPS consent separate from other processing
- **Informed** - Clear explanation of GPS usage and benefits
- **Unambiguous** - Explicit opt-in action required
- **Withdrawable** - App settings toggle with immediate effect

## Review and Monitoring

### Review Schedule

Annual review with updates following changes to regional laws or geolocation technologies.

### Monitoring

- Geo-blocking accuracy monitoring
- User appeal rate tracking
- Consent withdrawal rate monitoring
- Compliance with regional legal requirements
