## Implementation Refinements and Best Practices

### Execution Order (Optimized for Low-Flake Development)

**Phase 1: Foundation**

1. Task 5.3 (Deterministic environment) → Task 1 (Storybook) → Task 8 (Component states)
2. Task 2 (Design-tokens lint) + Task 3.1 (a11y lint integration)
3. Task 9 (Storybook Web with axe-core for design review)

**Phase 2: Core Testing** 4. Task 4.1 (Maestro capture) + Task 5.1 (masking) + Task 4.3/4.4 (visual engine/baselines) 5. Task 3.2-3.5 (a11y runtime + touch targets + dynamic type) 6. Task 7 (Safe areas + Android 15 edge-to-edge)

**Phase 3: Advanced Features** 7. Task 6 (Performance engine with release/Hermes builds) 8. Task 10 (GitHub Checks API) + Task 11 (Reports) + Task 12 (Resiliency)

### Key Implementation Details

**Android 15 Edge-to-Edge (Tasks 7.3, 4.1)**:

- Add explicit API 35 device to matrix for edge-to-edge enforcement testing
- Run snapshots with translucent system bars enabled
- Assert no content overlap with system UI
- Fail CI if insets aren't properly respected

**Maestro as Primary (Task 4.1)**:

- Include EAS job template and flow.yaml examples
- Cache Gradle/CocoaPods layers for performance
- Use Detox only for white-box React Native hooks when needed
- Document EAS Dev Client build profile and cache keys

**Visual Comparison Thresholds (Task 4.3)**:

- Make SSIM (≥0.990-0.995) and pixel diff (≤0.1-0.2%) configurable per device/theme
- Expose thresholds via visual.config.ts for per-suite overrides
- Use bezkrovny SSIM path from jest-image-snapshot
- Dark mode often needs slightly higher pixel diff tolerance

**Touch Target Validation (Task 3.3)**:

- Platform-specific: ≥44pt iOS, ≥48dp Android
- Add WCAG 2.2 target size validation for generic audits (useful for RN Web Storybook)
- Include hitSlop equivalent verification

**Pseudolocales (Task 5.2)**:

- Enable en-XA/ar-XB via gradle pseudolocales configuration
- Watch for filters that strip pseudolocales (resConfigs/aaptOptions)
- Provide fallback script to force-enable for CI environments
- Add pseudolocale pass rate and RTL mirror rate to reports

**Performance Monitoring (Tasks 6.1, 6.2)**:

- Measure in release builds with Hermes and Dev Mode OFF
- Use @shopify/react-native-performance marks for TTI/JS p95 per screen
- Sentry monitors slow/frozen frames with refresh-rate adaptive thresholds
- Log dropped_frames_p95 and js_frame_time_p95 per animation ID
- Store performance traces per commit for trend analysis

**Accessibility Auditing Enhancements (Task 3.2)**:

- Include UI graphics/components ≥3:1 contrast (borders/dividers), not just text
- Validate contrast in both light and dark themes
- Add automated focus order traversal with Maestro flow

**Safe Areas (Task 7.3)**:

- Prefer react-native-safe-area-context over basic SafeAreaView
- Add runtime assertions for portrait/landscape and notched devices
- Couple with Android 15 edge-to-edge snapshot testing

**GitHub Integration (Task 10.1)**:

- Single consolidated GitHub Check with story links, diffs, a11y errors, and perf deltas
- Better DX with reruns and annotations vs ad-hoc PR comments

**Storybook Web (Task 9.1)**:

- Publish as CI artifact per PR for design review without emulators
- Gate on axe-core violations to fail web Storybook build immediately
- Ensure designers see a11y issues in browser

**Baseline Management (Task 4.4)**:

- Retain last 30 baselines (not "30-day" time-based)
- Gate baseline updates behind "baseline-approved" label + design-review check
- Store commit SHA with each baseline for traceability

**Device Matrix (Task 4.1)**:

- iPhone SE/12/Pro Max + Pixel 6 + high-DPI Android
- Add one low-RAM Android device for realistic performance budget testing

**Flake Control (Tasks 4.5, 12.1)**:

- Retry once for known flaky tags
- Add Maestro delays for async lists
- Include network-off runs for offline states testing
- Pin font files in bundle + CI to prevent aliasing churn

**Deterministic Environment (Task 5.3)**:

- Pin font files in app bundle and CI environment
- Freeze Date.now, seed random, control animation speed
- Mask dynamic regions (clocks, cursors, system bars)
- Pre-render hooks to remove blinking elements

This refined implementation plan provides a production-ready roadmap that aligns with current React Native ecosystem best practices, platform standards, and proven CI/CD patterns for visual quality assurance.
