# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Strains Browser feature enables users to discover, explore, and save cannabis strain information within the GrowBro app. This feature integrates with "The Weed DB" API to provide comprehensive strain data including genetics, effects, growing characteristics, and detailed descriptions. The feature supports the app's educational mission by helping users make informed decisions about strain selection for their growing activities.
