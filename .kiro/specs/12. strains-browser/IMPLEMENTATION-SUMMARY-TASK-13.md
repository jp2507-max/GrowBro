# Task 13: Analytics and Monitoring Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive analytics tracking and performance monitoring for the strains feature, covering user interactions, API performance, FlashList rendering, image loading, and cache operations.

## Files Created

### 1. `src/lib/strains/strains-analytics.ts`

Type-safe analytics tracking utilities for user interactions:

- `trackStrainSearch()` - Search queries with filters and results
- `trackStrainFilterApplied()` - Individual filter applications
- `trackStrainSortChanged()` - Sort preference changes
- `trackStrainDetailViewed()` - Detail page views
- `trackStrainFavoriteAdded()` / `trackStrainFavoriteRemoved()` - Favorite actions
- `trackStrainListScrolled()` - Pagination/infinite scroll
- `trackStrainOfflineUsage()` - Offline usage patterns

### 2. `src/lib/strains/strains-performance.ts`

Performance monitoring utilities:

- `FlashListPerformanceTracker` - FPS and frame drop tracking
- `trackApiPerformance()` - API response times and errors
- `trackImagePerformance()` - Image loading metrics
- `trackCachePerformance()` - Cache hit rates and operations
- `PerformanceTimer` - Simple duration measurement
- `PerformanceAggregator` - Metric aggregation (avg, p95)

### 3. `src/lib/strains/use-strain-analytics.ts`

React hooks for analytics tracking:

- `useTrackStrainDetailView()` - Auto-track detail page views
- `useTrackStrainListScroll()` - Track pagination events
- `useTrackStrainOfflineUsage()` - Track offline patterns

### 4. `src/lib/strains/use-flashlist-performance.ts`

React hooks for performance monitoring:

- `useFlashListPerformance()` - Monitor FlashList FPS and frame drops
- `useImagePerformanceTracking()` - Track image load times
- `useCachePerformanceTracking()` - Track cache operations

### 5. `src/lib/strains/README-analytics.md`

Comprehensive documentation covering:

- All analytics events with payload schemas
- Usage examples for each tracking function
- Privacy and consent requirements
- PII sanitization details
- Performance utilities documentation
- Testing guidelines
- Monitoring dashboard recommendations

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/analytics.ts`

**Added Events:**

- Enhanced `strain_search` with filters, sort, and response time
- `strain_filter_applied` - Filter usage tracking
- `strain_sort_changed` - Sort preference tracking
- `strain_detail_viewed` - Detail page views
- `strain_favorite_added` / `strain_favorite_removed` - Favorite actions
- `strain_list_scrolled` - Pagination tracking
- `strain_offline_usage` - Offline patterns
- `strain_list_performance` - FlashList FPS metrics
- `strain_api_performance` - API response times
- `strain_image_performance` - Image loading metrics
- `strain_cache_performance` - Cache operations

**Updated Functions:**

- `createConsentGatedAnalytics()` - Added consent gating for all `strain_*` events
- `sanitizeAnalyticsPayload()` - Added sanitization for strain detail views

### 2. `src/api/strains/client.ts`

**Integrated Analytics:**

- Track search queries with response times in `getStrains()`
- Track API performance for both list and detail endpoints
- Track cache operations (read, write, evict) for ETag and memory caches
- Track offline usage when serving from cache

**Refactored for Code Quality:**

- Extracted `buildRequestConfig()` for request setup
- Extracted `handleSuccessResponse()` for success handling
- Extracted `handleErrorResponse()` for error handling
- All tracking methods use options objects to comply with max 3 parameters rule

### 3. `src/lib/strains/use-favorites.ts`

**Integrated Analytics:**

- Auto-track favorite additions with `trackFavoriteAnalytics()`
- Auto-track favorite removals with `trackFavoriteAnalytics()`
- Include total favorites count in tracking

## Key Features

### Privacy & Consent

- All `strain_*` events require user consent via `analytics` consent key
- Automatic PII sanitization for search queries (emails, phone numbers removed)
- Strain names truncated to 50 chars
- All identifiers use non-identifiable UUIDs

### Performance Monitoring

- **FlashList:** FPS tracking, frame drop detection (>32ms threshold)
- **API:** Response time tracking, error rate monitoring, cache hit rates
- **Images:** Load time tracking, failure detection, cache hit tracking
- **Cache:** Operation tracking (read/write/evict), hit rate calculation, size monitoring

### Non-Blocking Design

- All analytics tracking is async and non-blocking
- Failures are logged but don't impact user experience
- Lazy loading of analytics client to avoid circular dependencies

### Type Safety

- Strongly typed event payloads via `AnalyticsEvents` interface
- Type-safe tracking functions with proper parameter types
- Compile-time validation of event names and payloads

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Testing

- Use `InMemoryMetrics` for testing analytics tracking
- Mock analytics client for component tests
- Verify event payloads match expected schemas

### Integration Testing

- Test analytics tracking in real user flows
- Verify consent gating works correctly
- Test PII sanitization with various inputs

### Performance Testing

- Verify FlashList maintains >55 FPS with 1000+ items
- Test API response time tracking accuracy
- Validate cache hit rate calculations

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics to Track

**User Engagement:**

- Search query volume and patterns
- Filter usage distribution (which filters are most used)
- Detail page view rate (CTR from list)
- Favorite conversion rate

**Performance:**

- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- FlashList FPS and frame drops
- Image load times and failure rates
- Cache hit rates by type

**Offline Usage:**

- Offline action distribution
- Cached page availability
- Sync success rates

**Errors:**

- API error rates by type (4xx, 5xx)
- Image load failure rates
- Cache eviction frequency

## Compliance

### GDPR/Privacy

- All tracking requires explicit user consent
- PII is automatically stripped from all payloads
- Users can revoke consent at any time
- No tracking occurs without consent

### App Store Policies

- Analytics data collection is disclosed in privacy policy
- No sensitive personal data is collected
- All data is anonymized and aggregated
- Complies with Apple and Google analytics guidelines

## Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements

1. Add A/B testing support for feature variations
2. Implement funnel analysis for user journeys
3. Add cohort analysis for user retention
4. Create real-time performance dashboards
5. Add anomaly detection for performance regressions

### Integration Tasks

1. Connect analytics to backend analytics service (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude)
2. Set up monitoring dashboards in analytics platform
3. Configure alerts for performance degradation
4. Create weekly/monthly analytics reports
5. Integrate with crash reporting (Sentry)

## Code Quality

### ESLint Compliance

- All files pass ESLint checks
- Max 3 parameters per function (using options objects)
- Max 70 lines per function
- Proper kebab-case file naming

### TypeScript

- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types without justification
- Proper type imports and exports
- Full type coverage

### Performance

- Non-blocking async operations
- Lazy loading of dependencies
- Efficient data structures (Maps for caching)
- Memory-conscious (LRU eviction, size limits)
