## Performance SLAs & Acceptance Criteria

### FlashList v2 Policy

"All production lists use FlashList v2 with stable keyExtractor and getItemType for heterogeneous rows. No FlatList in src/\*\* (ESLint rule + CI check). Perf tests run on release builds only."

### Scroll Performance SLA

"30s continuous scroll over 1,000 items: avg FPS ≥58, P95 frame ≤16.7ms, dropped frames ≤1%, 0 blank cells. Capture RN Performance JSON + Perfetto FrameTimeline; publish as CI artifacts."

### Image Pipeline Standard

"List images use expo-image with disk+memory cache and BlurHash/ThumbHash placeholders; thumbnails only during scroll."

### Gesture Performance SLA

"During pan/drag, P95 input→render ≤50ms (Perfetto trace proof)."

### New Architecture Gate

"Expo SDK 53 build logs confirm Fabric/Turbo/bridgeless. Incompatible libs tracked & replaced."

### Sentry Configuration Standard

"Use tracesSampleRate: 0.1 (or tracesSampler) and enable React Navigation instrumentation for transition spans."
