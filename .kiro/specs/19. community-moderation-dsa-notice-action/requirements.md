# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive community moderation system that complies with Digital Services Act (DSA) Notice-and-Action procedures. The system will handle content reporting, moderation queues, decision-making workflows, appeals processes, and transparency reporting while enforcing age-gating and geo-visibility controls across all community feed surfaces.

The moderation system is critical for maintaining a safe, compliant, and trustworthy community environment within GrowBro, ensuring educational content standards while protecting users from harmful or inappropriate material.

## DSA Compliance Mapping

This system implements the following DSA articles:
