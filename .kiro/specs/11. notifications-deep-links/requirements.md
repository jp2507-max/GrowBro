# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive notification system for GrowBro that includes local notifications, push notifications, deep linking capabilities, and user notification preferences management. The system will handle community interactions (replies, likes), cultivation reminders, and provide seamless navigation through deep links while respecting user privacy and platform-specific requirements.

## Platform-Specific Foundation

### Notification Channels & Categories

- **Android 8+**: Mandatory notification channels with predefined importance levels and localized names/descriptions
- **iOS 15+**: Notification categories with interruption levels (.active, .timeSensitive) and thread identifiers for grouping
- **Channel/Category Matrix**:
  - `community.interactions` (Android) / `COMMUNITY_INTERACTIONS` (iOS) - Medium importance/.active
  - `community.likes` (Android) / `COMMUNITY_LIKES` (iOS) - Low importance/.active
  - `cultivation.reminders` (Android) / `CULTIVATION_REMINDERS` (iOS) - High importance/.timeSensitive
  - `system.updates` (Android) / `SYSTEM_UPDATES` (iOS) - Medium importance/.active

### Token Management

- Device tokens rotate unpredictably; fetch on startup and token refresh events
- Sync tokens to server with timestamps; purge stale tokens on send failures
- Handle token rotation after app reinstalls and data clears

### Privacy & Security

- Minimize PII in push payloads; keep sensitive details server-side
- Validate all deep-link parameters and allowlist routes
- Reject external redirects to prevent open-redirect phishing

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a GrowBro user, I want to receive push notifications for community interactions, so that I can stay engaged with replies and reactions to my posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another user replies to my post THEN the system SHALL send a push notification using `community.interactions` channel with reply preview (max 100 chars)
2. WHEN another user likes my post THEN the system SHALL send a push notification using `community.likes` channel with FCM collapse_key/APNs apns-collapse-id for deduplication
3. WHEN I tap on a community notification THEN the app SHALL launch Activity directly via PendingIntent.getActivity (Android 12+ trampoline compliance)
4. WHEN multiple interactions occur THEN the system SHALL group using collapseKey (FCM) for deduplication and threadIdentifier per post (iOS); note that client-side grouping is limited by expo-notifications API constraints
5. WHEN notification payload is created THEN it SHALL include deep link, message_id for tracking, and iOS thread-id for grouping
6. WHEN channels don't exist before posting THEN the notification SHALL fail on Android 8+ (channels must be pre-created)
