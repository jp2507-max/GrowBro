# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes comprehensive observability and quality monitoring for the GrowBro mobile application. The system will provide real-time insights into application health, user experience, and performance through Sentry integration, automated CI quality gates, performance tracing, and synthetic testing. This ensures high reliability and optimal user experience while maintaining development velocity through automated quality checks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated release health monitoring so that I can quickly identify and respond to issues affecting users in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new release is deployed THEN Sentry SHALL track crash-free sessions ≥ 99.9%, crash-free users ≥ 99.95%, ANR rate < 0.47%, slow frames < 5%, and frozen frames < 0.1%
2. WHEN releases are created THEN they SHALL have release, dist, and environment properties set in the React Native SDK with sessions enabled
3. WHEN source maps and native symbols are uploaded THEN Sentry CLI SHALL confirm processing with --wait flag and fail CI if upload fails
4. WHEN staged rollouts are active AND new release metrics cross thresholds for ≥30 minutes AND adoption >10% THEN rollout SHALL be paused automatically via Play Console and Sentry API
5. WHEN release health degrades significantly THEN the system SHALL halt rollout, reduce distribution, and open an incident with links to the Sentry Release page
6. WHEN releases have active sessions THEN crash-free sessions SHALL be displayed within 10 minutes of first adoption with source maps and dSYMs confirmed processed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want CI quality gates that prevent problematic releases so that we maintain high application stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a build is created THEN the CI system SHALL verify Sentry CLI confirms source maps and symbols uploaded with --wait flag to verify server processing
2. WHEN builds are processed THEN they SHALL confirm release/dist properties are present and RN Hermes/Gradle/Xcode steps succeeded
3. WHEN environments are configured THEN Sentry environments SHALL be set for staging and production
4. IF any prerequisite checks fail THEN the build SHALL be blocked with clear error messaging
5. WHEN evaluating pre-production deployment THEN the system SHALL query Sentry Sessions API for previous production release SLO compliance
6. IF previous production release is below SLO THEN promotion of new release SHALL be blocked until issues are resolved

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want performance monitoring for critical user flows so that I can identify and prioritize performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users perform critical actions THEN Sentry SHALL capture performance traces for app start (cold/warm), navigation transactions, sync operations, AI inference requests, image I/O, and WatermelonDB queries
2. WHEN performance monitoring is active THEN Mobile Vitals SHALL track slow/frozen frames and frame delay with Profiling enabled at sensible sampling rates (tracesSampleRate=0.2, profilesSampleRate=0.1)
3. WHEN distributed tracing is configured THEN mobile-to-API performance SHALL be visible end-to-end via trace headers
4. WHEN performance thresholds are defined THEN alerts SHALL trigger for Login p95 > 2.5s, Sync p95 > 3s, App Cold Start p95 > 2s
5. WHEN performance data is available THEN Sentry metric alerts SHALL provide automated notifications for threshold breaches
6. WHEN cold start performance is measured THEN p95 SHALL be < 2s on mid-tier Android devices with device-tiered SLOs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want session replay capabilities so that I can understand user behavior and reproduce issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Mobile Session Replay is enabled THEN it SHALL use sessionSampleRate=0.05 and onErrorSampleRate=1.0 with aggressive masking by default
2. WHEN sensitive screens are accessed THEN auth and payment screens SHALL be explicitly blocklisted with sendDefaultPii=false
3. WHEN replays are captured THEN they SHALL automatically link to error events and include user interactions while respecting privacy
4. WHEN data residency is required THEN EU region SHALL be configured with org-wide server-side PII scrubbing rules
5. WHEN privacy masking is verified THEN auth/payment screens SHALL be confirmed masked and replays linked to errors
6. WHEN storage and compliance are managed THEN intelligent retention policies SHALL implement data residency and scrubbing requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want synthetic monitoring of critical flows so that I can detect issues before users are affected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synthetic tests are configured THEN Maestro SHALL execute 3 production smoke flows: App start → Agenda render, Offline toggle → Task create/sync, and AI photo diagnosis happy-path
2. WHEN synthetic tests are scheduled THEN they SHALL run hourly in production and every 15 minutes in staging via Maestro Cloud
3. WHEN synthetic test results are processed THEN they SHALL pipe into Sentry using Cron Monitor check-ins so failures page on-call within existing alerting
4. WHEN synthetic tests fail THEN alerts SHALL include artifacts (screenshots/logs) and failure details for immediate investigation
5. WHEN test stability is maintained THEN stable selectors/testIDs, fixture accounts, and deterministic data SHALL be required with flake-retry policy (retry once before alerting)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile developer, I want comprehensive error tracking and crash reporting so that I can quickly identify and fix issues across different devices and OS versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN symbolication is configured THEN full JS source maps (Hermes), iOS dSYMs, and Android ProGuard mappings SHALL be uploaded on every build with CI failure if missing
2. WHEN errors and crashes occur THEN Sentry SHALL capture detailed reports with stack traces, device info, user context, and accurate file/line number mapping
3. WHEN ANRs and performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL track ANRs and JS event-loop stalls with dedicated ANR metric alerts aligned to Play thresholds
4. WHEN debugging context is needed THEN breadcrumbs SHALL capture navigation, network, device state (battery, connectivity), and custom tags (offline queue length, plant count)
5. WHEN errors are processed THEN they SHALL be automatically grouped and deduplicated with prioritization based on user impact
6. WHEN Expo/EAS integration is available THEN it SHALL be used for streamlined symbolication and crash reporting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want configurable alerting and escalation policies so that critical issues receive appropriate attention based on severity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring alerts THEN the system SHALL specify issue alerts vs. metric alerts with routing via PagerDuty/Opsgenie for critical and Slack/email for non-critical
2. WHEN critical issues occur THEN alerts SHALL immediately notify primary on-call with SMS and phone calls
3. WHEN primary on-call doesn't acknowledge within 5 minutes THEN alerts SHALL escalate to secondary on-call automatically
4. WHEN alert management is optimized THEN weekly alert reviews SHALL include threshold tuning, dynamic sampling, and consolidation of noisy rules
5. WHEN runbooks are provided THEN each critical alert SHALL link to documentation covering Sentry locations (Release page, Issues, Performance, Replay), rollout pause procedures, remote-config flags, and post-incident reporting

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want comprehensive SLOs and monitoring dashboards so that I can track system health and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SLOs are defined THEN the system SHALL track crash-free sessions ≥ 99.9%, crash-free users ≥ 99.95%, ANR rate < 0.47%, slow frames < 5%, frozen frames < 0.1%, MTTD < 5 min, and p95 Cold Start < 2s with device-tiered targets
2. WHEN environments are configured THEN staging and production SHALL be used consistently with Play staged rollout tied to Sentry health checks
3. WHEN quota management is active THEN sampleRate (errors), tracesSampleRate/tracesSampler, profilesSampleRate, Replay sampling, and Sentry rate limits SHALL be configured with spike protection to avoid quota burn during incidents
4. WHEN privacy compliance is required THEN org-level server-side scrubbing, restricted IP capture, and EU data residency SHALL be configured with replay masking checklist for DSR/PIA compliance
5. WHEN dashboards are available THEN Sentry dashboards SHALL provide SLO tracking and trend analysis for all defined metrics
