## Security Hardening Notes

**Apply while implementing:**

- Ensure Supabase RLS denies cross-tenant access by default; policies must explicitly allow `auth.uid()`
- Storage RLS restricts avatars to owner path; sign URLs with short TTL and do not store raw signed URLs persistently
- Do not store IP addresses on device; if collected server-side (with consent), enforce retention limit and access control
- Use SecureStore for secrets; encrypt WatermelonDB if configured; consider dev-only unencrypted fallback with explicit flag

## Notes

- All tasks marked with `*` are optional testing tasks that can be skipped if time is limited
- Core implementation tasks (1-14) should be completed in sequence
- Testing tasks (15) can be done in parallel with implementation or after core features are complete
- Documentation tasks (16) should be done last after all features are implemented and tested
- Each task should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- Refer to requirements.md and design.md for detailed specifications
