# Implementation Plan

_Current state (Oct 2025 audit): consumable inventory tables and UI are absent; only harvest inventory exists. WatermelonDB adapter + Expo plugin and global Sentry wiring are already in place._

- [x] 1. Set up enhanced database schema with proper foundations
  - Create Supabase migrations with BEFORE UPDATE triggers to auto-set updated_at on all three tables
  - Implement split RLS policies per command (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) with USING + WITH CHECK
  - Add FK constraints with CASCADE/SET NULL and CHECK constraints on movements enforcing sign by type
  - Create composite indexes matching filter patterns ((user_id, category), (item_id, expires_on))
  - Set up partial unique index for soft deletes: (item_id, lot_number) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
  - Add policy tests in CI to prevent RLS regressions and verify cross-user access denial
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 10.1, 10.3_

- [x] 2. Create WatermelonDB models with Expo config plugin setup
  - Confirm existing @morrowdigital/watermelondb-expo-plugin entry in app.config.cjs/package.json stays intact and create a CI guard so it cannot regress
  - Implement InventoryItem, InventoryBatch, and InventoryMovement models with @readonly timestamps
  - Add proper @relation decorators and ensure Movement model mirrors SQL schema exactly
  - Set up development build requirements and document custom native code requirements
  - Hook consumable tables into the existing WatermelonDB pullChanges/pushChanges scaffold with cursor pagination using (updated_at, id) tuple and domain-specific adapters
  - Add CI check that WatermelonDB plugin is configured and development build is required
  - _Requirements: 10.1, 10.2_

- [x] 3. Implement core inventory item management
  - Create InventoryItem CRUD operations with atomic transactions and proper validation
  - Add validation for required fields (name, category, unit, tracking_mode) with TypeScript types
  - Implement category management with predefined categories and custom category support
  - Add support for SKU, barcode, reorder settings, and lead time configuration
  - Create comprehensive unit tests for inventory item operations and validation rules
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 8.1_

- [x] 4. Build robust batch management with FEFO/FIFO policies
  - Implement InventoryBatch model with lot numbers, expiration dates, and integer cost tracking
  - Create FEFO picking logic (exclude expired by default, override with reason logging)
  - Implement FIFO costing (never revalue historical movements, cost from batch at pick time)
  - Add expired batch handling with explicit override capabilities and reason requirements
  - Write comprehensive tests for FEFO/FIFO edge cases and batch cost flow integrity
  - Document both policies in code comments and ensure test coverage for split consumption
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.6_

- [x] 5. Create immutable movement journal system
  - Implement InventoryMovement model with proper constraints and integer minor currency units. Use 64-bit integers for cost_cents in the DB and surface as BigInt or string in JS/TS to avoid precision loss across platforms.
  - Create movement types with quantity/cost validation and CHECK constraints by type
  - Implement RLS policy that forbids UPDATE and DELETE on the movements table (only INSERT allowed). Complement the policy with DB-level triggers that raise on attempted UPDATE/DELETE for defense-in-depth and clearer error messages for accidental mutations.
  - Implement atomic transaction handling such that any deductions + movement writes are committed together or rolled back together (no partial states)
  - Add idempotency support with a server-side Idempotency-Key store: scope the key to (user_id, method, path, hashed_body), persist the key + response for replay, set a TTL (recommend 24–72h), and ensure uniqueness within the scoped key space. Replay identical requests using the stored response instead of re-applying movements.
  - Add server-side caching of Idempotency-Key header and explicit replay semantics for duplicate detection
  - Write integration tests proving exactly-once behavior under retries and timeouts
  - Ensure 100% of inventory edits produce immutable movements for audit trails
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.3, 10.6_

- [x] 6. Implement automatic consumption with enhanced deduction logic
  - Create deduction mapping system accepting (source: 'task'|'manual'|'import', idempotencyKey?, allowExpiredOverride?)
  - Implement automatic inventory deduction with FEFO picking and FIFO costing integration
  - Prevent double-picks under contention by selecting batches FOR UPDATE (or FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED when appropriate) during allocation. Ensure the allocation SELECT and subsequent InventoryMovement INSERTs occur within the same DB transaction so locks cover the full write path.
  - Define default behavior for insufficient inventory (recommend: return an explicit `insufficient_stock` result and skip allocation by default; provide an optional `partial_fill` mode that consumes what is available). Make these behaviors idempotent across retries by tying allocation results to the provided idempotencyKey.
  - Emit a deterministic allocation order to guarantee stable idempotency: FEFO (earliest expires_on first) -> FIFO (oldest created_at) -> id ASC as the final tiebreaker. Use a single ORDER BY clause that implements this priority to ensure repeatable allocations.
  - Add transactional support ensuring all deductions + movement writes succeed or roll back
  - Create integration tests with existing task workflows proving no double-deduction on retries
  - Add per-plant scaling support and nutrient calculation integration
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6_

## Definition of Done Criteria

### Database & RLS (Task 1)

- Migrations run successfully on staging environment
- RLS policies deny cross-user access in unit tests
- updated_at automatically mutates on UPDATE operations
- Partial unique index allows soft-deleted lot reuse

### Sync (Task 13)

- WatermelonDB synchronize() completes with pull/push operations
- Only rows with (updated_at, id) > (last_pulled_updated_at, last_pulled_id) are returned
- Tombstones properly replicate soft deletes
- Conflict toast appears with "Reapply" creating new server write

### Performance (Tasks 7/16)

- Inventory list (≥1k items) cold-loads <300ms on Pixel-6-class device
- FlashList v2 maintains 60fps scrolling with stable keys + getItemType

### Notifications (Tasks 8/17)

- Android 13+ exact alarm permission properly requested
- Inexact alarm fallback + in-app banners work when permission denied
- Device matrix verification on Pixel + Samsung devices

### CSV (Task 9)

- Exports conform to RFC 4180 standard with UTF-8 encoding
- Imports are idempotent by external_key
- Re-importing same file yields zero net changes

### Costs (Tasks 10/12)

- All movements store integer minor units only
- FIFO cost equals batch cost at pick time
- Historical costs never change after creation
