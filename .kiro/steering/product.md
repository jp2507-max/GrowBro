- **Community Feed**: Share updates, like/comment on posts, real-time engagement
- **AI Photo Assessment**: Identify plant issues (deficiencies, stress, pests) with confidence scores and actionable guidance
- **Guided Playbooks**: Pre-built grow schedules (Auto/Photo × Indoor/Outdoor) that generate task calendars
